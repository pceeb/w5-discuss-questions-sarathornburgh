## This questions are due next discussion section (Week6).

1. Describe the Biology of your project? (one paragraph max).  
  Our project will be analyzing data collected from fish species in French Polynesia. Our data looks at the different bacteria in the fishes' microbiomes. We will be analyzing the differences in the microbiomes of the fishes' depending on their different diets and microbiomes.
2. Describe the kind of data that you think you will be handling (one paragraph max).  
Our data includes three sheets. One with fish taxonomic data, one with bacteria taxonomic data, and one with bacterial abundance in fish sample

3. What would you like to do with that data? (one paragraph max).  
Our goal is to merge all these data sets into one organized table.

4. What will be the output? (one paragraph max).  
The output will be one oranized table that can be put into R for easy analysis.

5. Is there any computational tool, package, etc. you would like to use? What would you do with that? For instance, you could mention shell scripts with `sed` or `awk` and will change the format of a table by replacing `,` with tabs. 
Also, you could mention tools that we haven’t seen in class yet but you herd that may be useful for your project. 
For instance, you could say 
***I will use the package “GenomeGraphs” implement in the R software to visualize genome data***. (a few sentences max).  
We will be using sed and awk to set up our tables.

6. What is your biggest concern regarding your project? (a few sentences max).
My biggest concern is being able to combine the data sheets sucessfully. Many of them have very different formatting that we need to make uniform across all of them before we can combine them.
